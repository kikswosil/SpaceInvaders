# SpaceInvaders
My attempt at recreating a classic Arcade-type game in java.  
 I created it with LibGDX in order to revise and learn design patterns.
## Requirements:
- Java 17
- Gradle
## Build and Run
### Windows: 
After cloning the repository run these  
methods in the folder it was cloned into.  
`.\gradlew build` to build the game.  
`.\gradlew run` to run the game.  
### Linux is not currently supported.
